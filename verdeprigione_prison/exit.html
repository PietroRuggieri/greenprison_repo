            You finally found the way out. <br> How much time has passed? <br>
            Hours, days, maybe months? <br>

           You stop trying to remember and go out while the exit is still in front of you. <br>
           Behind you the wind is howling inside the green maze, or maybe it's <span class="mino">something else</span>. <br>
